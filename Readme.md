# Review Javascript basic concepts

Separeted javascript files to remind me of basic concepts, organized by subjects and exercise files.

Following the course Javascript Basics by Mosh Hamedami.

1. For testing in the browser I used Live Server pluging for vsCode as recommended in the course.
2. index.html includes just one of the files at the time, so not to clutter the dev console.
3. Organize concepts in files by order and exercises as well. In some of these I added my own versios or tweaks as well comments
